          Isaac Newton is well known for his discoveries in optics (white light
          composition) and mathematics (calculus), it is his formulation of the
          three laws of motion—the basic principles of modern physics—for which
          he is most famous.

      <div id="timeline">
        <ul id="timeline-ul">
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1642 - Isaac Newton was born in the village of Woolsthorpe, England.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1653 - A legend says that a falling apple struck Isaac Newton on the
            head as he sat thinking under an apple tree. In that moment he was
            said to have understood the law of gravity.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1661 - Trinity College, Cambridge, England.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1665–67 -Newton receives his bachelor’s degree in 1665, but the
            mathematical and scientific studies he has undertaken during his
            undergraduate years are still unknown to the world.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1668 - Newton invents the reflecting telescope.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1669–71 - Newton becomes a professor of mathematics at Trinity
            College and writes the tract De Analysi per Aequationes Numero
            Terminorum Infinitas (“On Analysis by Equations with an Infinite
            Number of Terms”) in 1669.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1672 - Newton sends a paper on light and colors to the Royal
            Society. The paper is generally well received, though some dissent
            is voiced and one of the society’s leaders, Robert Hooke, writes a
            critique of it.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1684–87 - Toward the end of 1684 Newton sends a short tract entitled
            De Motu (“On Motion”) to British astronomer Edmond Halley. Newton
            continues to improve and expand this work and in 1687 publishes the
            landmark Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, (The
            Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). One of the
            fundamental works of modern science, it sets forth his three basic
            laws of motion and law of universal gravitation.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1696 - Newton is appointed warden of the mint and moves to London
            (although he does not resign from Cambridge until 1701). As warden
            of the mint and, soon after, master of the mint, in charge of
            issuing currency, Newton oversees the replacement of currency with
            new coins and relishes his authority in catching counterfeiters.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1703 - Newton is elected president of the Royal Society.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1704 - Newton publishes the first edition of Opticks, a work
            summarizing his research in light and colors.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1705 - Queen Anne knights Newton, the first time a scientist
            receives the honor.
          </li>
          <li class="timeline-li">
            1727 -Newton dies in London, England, and is buried at Westminster
            Abbey.
